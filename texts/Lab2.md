## **Lab No. 2**

### **Aim**

To examine the security vulnerabilities and get to know how to detect the security vulnerabilities in systems and networks.

### **Theory**

Security vulnerabilities are the sections that may be used by the attackers to access information systems without permission or cause destruction to the information systems. Generally, vulnerabilities may be classified in terms of the asset and the mechanism involved:

### **Types of Vulnerabilities**

1. **Network Vulnerabilities**:

These exist in network devices like routers, firewalls, and switches. If exploited, it can lead to unauthorized access, data interception, denial of service, or lateral movement within the network.​

1. **Operating System Vulnerabilities**:

Vulnerabilities in OS can allow privilege escalation or remote code execution, often due to unpatched software or misconfigurations.

2. **Application Vulnerabilities**:

Flaws in software applications, such as buffer overflows or improper input validation, may allow attackers to execute code or disrupt normal operation.​

3. **Database Vulnerabilities**:

Errors in database systems, like SQL injection, could leak sensitive information or even the entire database.

4. **Security Protocol Vulnerabilities**:

Weaknesses in cryptographic or network protocols (e.g., SSL/TLS misconfigurations, insecure cipher suites) can make data interception or tampering easier.​

### **Vulnerability Detection Methods**

1. **Vulnerability Scan**:

Automated tools like Nessus and OpenVAS run scans across hosts and applications to detect known vulnerabilities using signature and behaviour analysis.​

2. **Penetration Testing**:

Penetration testers simulate attacks on a system to discover exploitable weaknesses. Both manual and automated techniques are used to identify and validate vulnerabilities.​

3. **Network Monitoring**:

Tools analyze traffic for suspicious or anomalous activity, which may indicate exploitation attempts.

4. **Code Review**:

Security experts inspect source code to locate security flaws that may be missed by automated tools.

5. **Protocol Scanners**:

These target specific network services or protocols to uncover weaknesses (e.g., open or misconfigured ports).​

Detection typically involves both automated scans and manual validation, followed by risk analysis using standards such as CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System). Vulnerabilities are documented and prioritized for remediation.
